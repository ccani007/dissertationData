Description: 
     This package contains cleaned datasets from the Youth Risk Behavior 
     Surveillance System (YRBS) for the years 2019 and 2023. The central goal
     of this project is to facilitate research on adolescent suicide attempts,
     initially for my (Catalina) dissertation, but now for anyone committed 
     to **evidence-based decision-making**!
