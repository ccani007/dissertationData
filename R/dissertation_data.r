#' @description This dataset, curated specifically for training models in my
#'      dissertation, encompasses variables from the YRBS 2017, 2019, and 2021
#'      datasets. Additionally, several variables have been specifically
#'      constructed by combining common variables; for example,
#'      'RiskDrivingBehaviors' is a composite variable derived from
#'      'SeatBeltUse', 'TextingDriving', 'DrivingDrinking', and
#'      'DrinkingDriver'. The selection of variables is strategically focused
#'       on analyzing suicidality Rigorous curation ensured that each included
#'       variable has less than 80% missing data. The selection prioritizes
#'       variables that are pertinent to the analysis of suicidality.
#'       For details on the exclusion criteria and a list of removed variables,
#'       refer to 'inst/scripts/creatingCompleteDataset.qmd'.
#'       NOTE: Missing data for SuicideAttempts
#'
#'#' This dataset exclusively comprises questions sourced from Appendix A of the
#' YRBS 2017, 2019, and 2021, specifically focusing on the QN dichotomous variables.
#' For comprehensive information, please refer to the documentation
#' provided in the 2017, 2019, and 2021 National YRBS Data Users Guide. In this dataset,
#' each variable follows a binary pattern: a value of 1 indicates the
#' presence of the specified behavior, while a value of 0 signifies its
#' absence. For instance, with regard to Suicide Attempts, a value of 1
#' signifies that adolescents responded affirmatively to having made
#' suicide attempts, whereas 0 indicates a negative response.
