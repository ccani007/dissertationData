- **Data Download from CDC Website:**
On this date, both the YRBS datasets for the years 2019 and 2021 were downloaded from the official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. The data was obtained using SPSS syntax to ensure accuracy and consistency. Following the download, the files were stored inside the "extData" directory of the repository.

- **Data Transformation to .rda Format:**
On the same date, the SPSS files containing the YRBS data were transformed into a more convenient and efficient format for inclusion in the package. The datasets were converted to .rda files, making them compatible with R and facilitating their seamless integration into the repository.

- **YRBS 2017 Data Cleaning Finished:**
The cleaning process for the YRBS 2017 data has been completed.

- **Combined Dataset Created (2017, 2019, and 2021):**
I have successfully merged three datasetsâ€”2017, 2019, and 2021. To ensure consistency, I have retained only the variables that are common across all three datasets. As a result, I have created four different datasets: one comprehensive dataset for each year and a combined dataset containing only the variables present in all three years.

- **Documentation Completed:**
The documentation for all four datasets has been finalized.
