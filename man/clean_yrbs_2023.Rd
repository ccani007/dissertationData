\description{
This is the imported and cleaned 2023 YRBS Data.
This data set monitors priority health risk behaviors that contribute
markedly to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems
among youth and adults in the United States.

This dataset exclusively comprises questions sourced from Appendix A of the
YRBS 2023, specifically focusing on the QN dichotomous variables.
For comprehensive information, please refer to the documentation
provided in the 2023 National YRBS Data Users Guide. In this dataset,
each variable follows a binary pattern: a value of 1 indicates the
presence of the specified behavior, while a value of 0 signifies its
absence. For instance, with regard to Suicide Attempts, a value of 1
signifies that adolescents responded affirmatively to having made
suicide attempts, whereas 0 indicates a negative response.

These broad categories are:
\itemize{
\item Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence
\item Sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and
sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection
\item Alcohol and other drug use
\item Tobacco use
\item Unhealthy dietary behaviors
\item Inadequate physical activity
