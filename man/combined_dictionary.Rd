It allows users to track how survey variables have changed over the years, including changes in question wording and structure.

\details{
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS) Dictionary - Combined Years

The dictionary is structured as a data frame with six columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Variable Name} - The name of the variable as it appears in the datasets.
\item \strong{2015â€“2021} - Columns representing each year, indicating the question associated with the variable for that specific year.
}

This dictionary is useful for researchers who need to ensure consistency across years
when analyzing trends, as some questions may have been renamed, modified, or removed in different survey waves.
